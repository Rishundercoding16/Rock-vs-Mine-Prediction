# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
This project implements a binary classification machine learning model to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. The model is trained on numerical sonar return data, where each feature represents the strength of the signal reflected at different frequencies.

🔍 Problem Statement

Identifying underwater objects accurately is critical in naval and defense applications. This project aims to classify sonar signals into Rock (R) or Mine (M) using supervised learning techniques.

🧠 Approach
	•	Performed data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
	•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets
	•	Trained a classification model using Logistic Regression
	•	Evaluated the model using accuracy score

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	NumPy
	•	Pandas
	•	Scikit-learn

  📊 Results

The trained model successfully classifies sonar signals with good accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in signal-based object detection.

🚀 Key Learnings
	•	Hands-on experience with binary classification
	•	Understanding real-world signal data
	•	Model training, evaluation, and prediction workflow in ML
